This is a simple Node.js example application.

## Description
This application will expose a Rest API that will return data fetched from a Rest API mocking website called Beeceptor. It uses Express to expose the data and Axios to fetch data from Beeceptor.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
As every Node application you should have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. 
### Installing
Run ```npm i``` to install its dependencies.
### Testing
You can run the Jest unit tests with ```npm run test```.
### Executing the program
Run ```npm run start``` to start the application. You can then go to http://localhost:3000/wizards to get the data.
